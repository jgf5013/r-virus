# R-Virus

## Running Locally
You can run the web app locally by installing node and npm, or by using Dev-Containers. Dev-Containers is the recommended approach if you don't already have node and npm set up.

- Dev Containers (IDE-specific)
  - VS Code
    - Install [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
    - Close and reopen the project. VS Code should run some background processes to set up the tooling for you
  - Instructions for other IDEs not given :P
- Install Tools Locally
  - Install [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Run `npm install` from the root directory
  - Run `npm run dev` from the root directory
  - I'm probably missing some steps here...
